Opening the call/chat
The call opening must be simple, clear, and Customer\-focused. Greet your caller within 10
seconds after the beep indicates an inbound call.
Suggested call opening:

Rewards Checking Thank you for calling American Express National Bank. My Name is
Example \[Your name] May I take your first and last name, Account Number or
Business Name please?
Suggested call opening:

take your First and Last Name?

Suggested chat opening:
• â€œI will be glad to review this for you.â€� or
• â€œI am reviewing this for you. Allow me a few moments
please.â€�
Points to remember:
• As customers are already greeted by virtual assistant (VA), chat
opening is not required again unless there is no prior VA interaction.
Business/Rewards • To promote seamless conversation between customer, VA, and
Checking Chat CCPs it is suggested not to release your name proactively, unless
Example customer specifically asks who they are chatting with.
• In case of high wait time, acknowledge it before moving further for
servicing.
• If customer says Agent, CCP, Live Person, or any keyword that
denotes theyâ€™d like to chat with a live agent, only then
acknowledge with the introduction:
• â€œYou are now connected with a live person, my name is
xxxxxx.â€�
There is no chat opening and re\-verification required on the chat for the
security questions and name if customer connects back within an hour and
ID validation answers from previous chat are visible.
While Servicing the Call it is important to refer to the Customer (Primary/Joint \- for Rewards
Checking) accordingly:
• The caller's first name.
• The caller's last name, except in the situations noted below.
• The callerâ€™s preference as to how to address them throughout the call.
Exceptions to including the caller's last name:
• They prefer you call them by their first name.
• You are unsure if you should use a prefix or title (Example, Mr. or Ms.)
• You are unable or unsure how to pronounce their last name.
Greeting Examples:
• Great, thank you for providing that information and how would you like to be addressed on
this call today? Thank you {insert preferred name}. How may I help you today?
• Thank you for providing that information. May I call you (insert first name)? Great and
how can I help today (insert preferred name)?
• Thank you for providing that information and how would you like to be addressed on this
call today? Thank you (insert preferred name). I have your business account for (Insert
Business Name) How may I help your business today?

• If the caller asks for your full name and / or additional information, provide your legal first
name and your agent ID.
Suggested response: \\"Mr. / Ms. XXXX, all Customer Care Professionals have an

Call Recording Disclosure Inbound

unless the Caller has declined being recorded. The FCC prohibits the recording of calls unless
both parties consent to the recording.
Call Recording Disclosure

requirements.

conversation with your caller.

Call Recording Handling Scenarios
Note: Callers hear a pre\-recorded message advising that the call may be monitored or recorded
for quality purposes and fraud prevention.
Below are some scenarios that may occur:
• We do not allow parties outside the company or partner companies to
Caller is record our phone calls. If the caller states that, they are recording the
Recording the call, advise the caller I do not give you permission to record this
Call call and continue to resolve the callerâ€™s concerns / inquiries.
• Document the account indicating that the caller wanted to record the
call and permission to record the call was not given.
• There are certain cell phone applications that allow a caller to bypass
the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) menu. In these instances, the
Cellphone Customer Care Professionals (CCPs) may hear some type of automated
Applications response prompting them to complete some action in order to connect
with the caller (for example, please press 1 to be connected). When this
occurs, the CCP is required to provide the call recording disclosure.
Apps like LucyPhone and FastCustomer are designed to wait on hold for
callers. The caller selects or enters a customer service number of the company
they want to contact. When placed on hold, they follow the instructions in the
app to schedule a call back when a Customer Service Representative answers
the phone.
Refer to the table below if you receive one of these calls.

active in the system. Also, encourage the Customer to access their account by logging in online to
keep their accounts active.
", "
Disconnecting a Call
Once the conversation with the Customer / Prospect is complete and all their questions and
concerns have been addressed, you can release the call.

disconnect script is still required.

Disconnecting a Chat

Dropped Call
When a Business/Rewards Checking Customer (Primary/Joint) / Prospect is disconnected, use
this procedure to attempt to call them back within 15 minutes. This applies to servicing calls only
where the Customer is fully authenticated, or the Prospect telephone number is captured during
the application process.

Important Notes:
• For outbound calls: Customer Care Professionals (CCPs) must state their Name and are
suggested to identify themselves as American Express National Bank. Refer to: Call
Recording Disclosure Outbound section.
• CCPs are suggested to close the call with American Express National Bank.
• Anytime the call is transferred to another party, the CCP is required to advise that the call is
being recorded.
• Only use phone numbers on file for the party you were speaking to, do not use phone
numbers listed for any other person on the account.
• If calls are in queue, take the next incoming call and make your best attempt to call them
back within 15 minutes. If the call back cannot be placed within the 15\-minute timeframe,
document the account, and move on.
Follow the steps in the Providing Your Name section above.

is made.

Handling a Prank Call
A prank call is one that is made for the amusement of the caller with no intention or need for
legitimate Customer service. The caller may attempt common or meaningless conversation or
may otherwise attempt to keep you engaged for no practical purpose.
Follow the steps below when you receive a prank call.
Step 1
Attempt to establish whether the caller has a legitimate need for assistance. Callers with speech,
language differences, or hearing challenges are valid Customers but may be initially
unresponsive.

Step 2
Attempt to obtain an account number from the caller. If, after requesting an account number 3
times and one is not provided, tell the caller that you are going to disconnect the call.
Suggested Response:
• \\"May I please have your account number? I am unable to assist you without that
information.\\"
• \\"Do you have a question regarding American Express National Bank? I cannot stay on the
line unless you need Customer service assistance.\\"
• \\"I am sorry, but unless you have a question that American Express National Bank is able
to assist with, I must release this call.\\"
• \\"I am disconnecting the call now.\\"
Keep in mind that we have legitimate callers who would not have an account number (prospect).
A caller may request general information that we can provide without obtaining an account
number.
Step 3
Release the call.
